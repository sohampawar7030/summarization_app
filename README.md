# ðŸ“š Text Summarization App with Groq API 

Welcome to the **ðŸ“š Text Summarization App**! This app leverages the **Groq API** for generating summaries of text from various inputs, including manual text entry and PDF uploads. Additionally, it includes a chatbot feature to interact with the app and get real-time responses.

## Features
- **Manual Text Input**: Paste or type any text, and the app will summarize it using the Groq API.
- **PDF Upload**: Upload a PDF file, and the app will extract the text and summarize it. You can also download the summarized content as a new PDF.
- **Chat with Bot**: Engage in a chat with a helpful assistant to answer questions or provide summaries of any input.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **Groq API**: For natural language processing and text summarization.
- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF files.
- **ReportLab**: For generating PDF summaries.
- **Pillow**: For image handling (if required).
- **Python-dotenv**: For loading environment variables securely.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Python 3.7+ installed.
